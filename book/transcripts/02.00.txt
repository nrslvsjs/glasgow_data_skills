In chapter 1, we learned how to use the RStudio integrated development environment, or IDE, to create scripts using the R coding language and documents using R Markdown.

We also learned how to type commands in to the console, basically using the console like a calculator. We assigned values to some variables, and used those variables in functions, like the function paste().

We learned how to install a package from CRAN using the RStudio interface or the console, and we installed the class package, dataskills, from github.

We also created a project to keep our class exercises in, learned how to create and knit an RMarkdown document, and how to get the chapter exercises with the dataskills function exercise().

Now let's open up your class project and create a new R Markdown file for Chapter 2.

Chapter 2 will get you familiar with the different types of data in R and how you can get your own data into and out of R.

1. Understand the use the basic data types
2. Understand and use the basic container types
3. Create vectors and store them as variables
4. Understand vectorized operations
5. Create a data table
