## Mutating joins

### Question 1A

Load data from [disgust_scores.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_scores.csv) (`disgust`), [personality_scores.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/personality_scores.csv) (`ocean`) and [users.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/users.csv) (`user`). Each participant is identified by a unique `user_id`.

```{r ex-1a}
disgust <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_scores.csv")
ocean <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/personality_scores.csv")
user <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/users.csv")
```

### Question 1B

Add participant data to the disgust table.

```{r ex-1b}
study1 <- left_join(disgust, user, by = "user_id")
```


### Question 1C

*Intermediate*: Calculate the age of each participant on the date they did the disgust questionnaire and put this in a column called `age_years` in a new table called `study1_ages`. Round to the nearest tenth of a year. 

```{r ex-1-i}
study1_ages <- study1 %>%
  mutate(
    age = date - birthday,
    age_days = as.integer(age),
    age_years = round(age_days/365.25, 1)
  )
```

### Question 2A

Add the participant data to the disgust data, but have the columns from the participant table first.

```{r ex-2}
study2 <- right_join(user, disgust, by = "user_id")
```


### Question 2B

*Intermediate*: How many times was the disgust questionnaire completed by each sex? Create a table called `study2_by_sex` that has two columns: `sex` and `n`.

```{r ex-2-i}
study2_by_sex <- study2 %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```


### Question 2C

*Advanced*: Make a graph of how many people completed the questionnaire each year.
    
```{r ex-2-a}
study2 %>%
  mutate(year = substr(date, 1, 4)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(times_completed = n()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(year, times_completed, fill = year)) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Times Completed"
  ) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
  
```
    

### Question 3A

Create a table with only disgust and personality data from the same `user_id` collected on the same `date`.

```{r ex-3}
study3 <- inner_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
```


### Question 3B

*Intermediate*: Join data from the same `user_id`, regardless of `date`. Does this give you the same data table as above?
    
```{r ex-3-i}
study3_nodate <- inner_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id"))
```


### Question 4

Create a table of the disgust and personality data with each `user_id:date` on a single row, containing _all_ of the data from both tables.

    
```{r ex-4}
study4 <- full_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
```

## Filtering joins

### Question 5

Create a table of just the data from the disgust table for users who completed the personality questionnaire that same day.
    
```{r ex-5}
study5 <- semi_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
```

    
### Question 6

Create a table of data from users who did not complete either the personality questionnaire or the disgust questionnaire. (_Hint: this will require two steps; use pipes._)

    
```{r ex-6}
study6 <- user %>%
  anti_join(ocean, by = "user_id") %>%
  anti_join(disgust, by = "user_id")
```

## Binding and sets

### Question 7

Load new user data from [users2.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/users2.csv). Bind them into a single table called `users_all`.

```{r ex-7}
user2 <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/users2.csv")
users_all <- bind_rows(user, user2)
```


### Question 8

How many users are in both the first and second user table?
    
```{r ex-8}
both_n <- dplyr::intersect(user, user2) %>% nrow()
```

### Question 9

How many unique users are there in total across the first and second user tables?

```{r ex-9}
unique_users <- dplyr::union(user, user2) %>% nrow()
```

### Question 10

How many users are in the first, but not the second, user table?

```{r ex-10}
first_users <- dplyr::setdiff(user, user2) %>% nrow()
```

### Question 11

How many users are in the second, but not the first, user table?

```{r ex-11}
second_users <- dplyr::setdiff(user2, user) %>% nrow()
```
